# ðŸŒŒ AI Application: Deep Dream and Adversarial Examples for CNNs

This project explores the application of the Deep Dream algorithm and adversarial examples in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), illustrating both creative and robustness perspectives in AI. The project enables visualization and manipulation of the internal features of CNNs while studying how these networks can be influenced by adversarial perturbations.
Project Overview

## The project has two main objectives:

- Creative Visualization with Deep Dream: Using the Deep Dream algorithm to amplify and visualize specific image features, generating abstract, dream-like images based on the internal filters of a CNN.
- Robustness and Adversarial Examples: Creating adversarial examples by applying small, targeted modifications to input images that mislead the CNN model. This technique highlights the vulnerabilities of deep learning models to adversarial attacks.

## Key Components

- Deep Dream for Visualization: Implements the Deep Dream algorithm to manipulate the outputs of deep layers in the CNN, producing visually surreal images.
- Adversarial Examples: Generates adversarial examples using techniques like FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) to explore model weaknesses when exposed to perturbations.
- Intermediate Feature Analysis: Analyzes CNN layers to understand how each layer perceives and reacts to details in an image.
